        -[ 3 Act Structure Reference](http://www.elementsofcinema.com/screenwriting/three-act-structure/)
        - **Act 1 - Setting**
          - The first act is where all the major characters of the story are introduced, plus the world where they live in, and the conflict that will move the story forward.
          - **The Hook**
            - an exciting scene early in the script that grabs the audience’s interest and hooks them.
          - **The Inciting Incident**
            - takes place somewhere in the beginning of Act I. This inciting incident often provokes a change in the protagonist’s routine – something new they experience that could either challenge or encourage them. 
          - Ends with the first plot-point of the story.
        - **Act 2 - Confrontation**
          - The stakes escalates over here. All the characters and setting is introduced already.
          - Sub-plots may be introduced over here.
          - If the hero is “on the fence” or confused about what he should do, then something must happen by the **midpoint** of the script to make his goal clear. Aka. Also know as the **Handout Moment**.
        - **Act 3 - Resolution**
          - Act III presents the final confrontation of the movie, followed by the **denouement.** This act is usually the shortest in length because quickly after the second turning point of the script, the main character is face to face with the villain or just about. Showdown ensues and then conclusion.
          - Also when the writer ties up any loose ends and offers a resolution to the subplots.
   
    - **Robert Mckee - The Quest**
      - ![The Quest](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3UylkpyLLvk/SsnL_Z_q9LI/AAAAAAAAAeg/G7RZMUbwKxc/s400/robert-mckee-quest.gif)
        - Each line represents a scene.
          - If the protaganist starts of positive at the start of the scene, he has to end off negatively; vice-versa is also true.
          - A Scene represents an exchange of value
        - A series of lines (scenes) represent an Sequence
          - Represents an even greater exchange of value.
        - The Inciting Incident marks the end of the Act.
        - Conscious desire
          - The viewer knows what the goal is, explicitly said from the start.
        - Unconscious desire
          - Goals that are formed due to the events at unfold and how the character's psych reacts to them. They are slowly revealed to the viewer as we observe the character.
