## Character Archetypes
- Introduction
  - Templates that help to create interesting, dynamic and rounded characters in their story.
  - Invented by Volger
    - Archetypes is an indispensable tool for understanding the purpose or function of characters in a story.
    - Archetype is a word that means a person who assumed a particular role, possess all the universal traits or characteristics that are normally associated with that role.
    - Universal refers to what almost all races and cultures of the world agree as the defined set of charactersitcs pertaining to the role under discussion.
      - For example: Motherly refers to 
        - Nurturing
        - Loving
        - Caring
        - Selfless
        - Patient
        - Calm
      - For example: Hilter refers to
        - Murderous
        - Manipulative
        - Cowardly
        - Devious
        - Evil
    - A Character can wear one mask for the whole story but they might not
    stay that way, it depends on the story.
    - Its important to note that even the main protagonist may start off with negative traits that aren't considered heroic only to change midway.
    - Even villains may also turn over a new leaf and become a helper/mentor.
## 6 Main Archetypes
The following are templates which will give you an idea on how to write a character. Note that they are not blueprints and rules can be ommited in favour of a better character.
- **Hero**
  - The word "hero" is Greek, from the root that means "to protect and to serve".
  - A Hero is someone who is willing to sacrifice his won needs on behalf of others for the sake of protecting them.
  - There are seven types of heroes
    - Willing Hero
      - They come to their position on their own volition.
        - King Arthur
        - Hercules
    - Unwilling Hero
      - They are unwilling to fulfill their duty but eventually does so. They require convincing; either from a third party or from a turning point.
        - Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit
        - Spiderman
    - Cynical Anti-Hero
      - They do heroic things but does so for not so heroic motivations.
        - Like bounty hunters, who hunt criminals not for peace but for money.
      - Han Solo from Star Wars
    - Tragic Anti-Hero
      - They do heroic things but does so because of a tragic past or a flawed outlook to the world.
      - Darth Vader
    - Group Oriented Hero
      - Works with a group to perform heroic deeds
    - Loner Hero
      - Indiana Jones
    - Catalyst Hero
      - Begins the cause and helps people along the way to help the cause.
      - Very similar to the *mentor* archetype.
- **Mentor**
  - A Mentor is any character who is wise and who generally
    - Teach, Advises, Guides and most importantly Corrects.
  - In line with that definition, mentors must do the following.
    - Teaching and Gift-giving
      - Must reward the student for doing certain things well.
  - To fulfil these responsibilities
    - The mentor may test the Hero, so that the Gifts bestowed are earned.
    - Motivate the Hero when he is fearful (perhaps when the Hero is refusing the Call to Adventure because he is afraid)
    - Provide the Hero with vital information, may not even teach the Hero formally. The act of giving his crucial information to start his journey is enough to catergorise him as a mentor.
  - A Symbol of wisdom, skills and guidance.[p]
- **Herald**/**Harbinger**
  - Herald announces the existence of the guidance, they might not be providing any guidance to the Hero
  - May not be a person for that matter, eg. A Letter can be a Herald/Harbinger.
    - They can also be that of the hero's own inner voice compelling him/her to
      follow the Call to Adventure, which sets the hero's journey into motion.
  - Herald = Positive, Harbinger = Negative
  - Plays the role of a catalyst, as well as that of an announcer
    - They set the story in motion with their announcement.
- **Shapeshifter**
  - Shapeshifting is a common theme in mythology and folklore as well as in
    science fiction and fantasy.
      To understand this concept, you must be aware of the multiple meanings crouched in the broad and narrow sense.
        - Broad Shift
          - Physical changes-changing appearance.
        - Narrow Shift
          - Mental changes - which means we are looking at changes in terms of characteristics.
  - **Broad Shift**
    - Shapeshifting also refers to the alteration of one's physical form voluntarily.
      - Forceful alteration refers transfiguration by another external entity, forced against the person's will.
    - Used as a plot-device to help with the reinforcement of theme.
      - When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect is one of confinement, restraint and disablement
        - The person is bound to the new form perhaps temporarily.
        - However, in extreme cases, such as petrification eg. Medusa, the character is entirely disabled.
      - When a form is taken on voluntarily, it means empowerment to escape/navigate a certain situation.
        - The person takes a new form to gain new powers to deal with his situation.
    - Shapeshifters can also be used to distract and deceive the protaganist from      his goals.
  - **Narrow Shift**
    - Eg. Powers cannot be controlled by the protaganist.
    - An example of a narrow shift shapeshifter is those whose loyalty, motives and wants are questionable. Eg. Double Agents: Pretends to be on your side then shifts to the other side.
    - Can lead the hero through the quest, thorugh an elusive game of hide-and-seek, constantly calling into question their own sincerity and that of the protaganist.
      - Though the audience not sure if they are going to guide... or elude.
    - **Animus**
      - The animus is the unconscious masculine side of a woman protagonist.
      - Its the idea that our gender opposite is lying dormant in ourselves
        - Gender is a construct that society has created
      - The male version is called the animas, the female unconsciousness lying underneath the male.
        - The anima has feminine traits, caring, loving , tenderness and compassion which are largely seen as womanly traits.
        - The animus has masculine traits, dominant, aggressive, territorial and violent which are largely seen as manly traits.
- **Shadow**
  - Also know as the doppelganger, german for ghostly double
  - Refers to the darker side of the psych, representing wildness, choas and the unknown.
  - It can be the symbol of our hidden dark, eveil and unspeakable nature and desires. The sum of all those unpleasant, repressed qualities we like to hide.
  - The Shadow is defined as the "thing a person has no wish to be".
  - It represents the dark but knowable nature of men such as racist and discriminatory tendencies, bigotry, pride and unspeakable cruelty concealed under our civilized veneer.
  - This archetype serves as a reminder that the negative qualities are present in us and if we are not careful, they will rear their ugly head.
- **Trickster**
  - The Trickster brings change by upsetting the balance of things.
  - Trickers bring change by drawing attention to the imbalance or absurdity of a stagnant situation and often provokes laughter.
  - They might not always be comedic but serves to bring out the stupidity or to humiliate or outwit the protagonist. They typically use non-deadly methods, often comedic in nature.

  ## Wrap up
  - By combining different archetypes together, we can make interesting and multi-dimensonal characters.
  - The above roles are just a guide and not a blueprint to make a character.
  - A Character can change roles as the story progresses, they also might mean different roles to different characters to the story.
