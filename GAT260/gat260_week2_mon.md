# Week 1 - GAT260 (Monday)
## Topic: Visual Structure
---
## Hard to read, by design.
- Sometimes, making things more awkward to read is better
  - For example, Right-align vs left align (ragged left/right)
    - Left align reads more naturally, easy to process information but in turn easier to miss information as well.
    - Right align reads more awkwardly, hard to read information and takes more effort to read but that effort makes sure you don't miss anything
## Structure can help users read long bits for information.
- 135561123591 vs 1355 6112 3591, the latter is more easier to read and remember.
- Structure can help users remember long bits of information as smaller size of information is easier to remember.
## Visual hierarchy lets people focus on the relevant information
- Break information into distinct sections and break large sections into sub sections
- Label sections accordingly in such a way that its easy to identify content.
- Make important sections more distinct to draw user attention.
  - **Size.** The more important something is, the larger it should be.
  - **Prominence.** The more important something is, the higher it should be on the page. Users need not scroll so far to see it.
  - **Content relationships.** Group similar content types by displaying the content in a similiar visual style or in a clearly defined area.
## Conceptual Model
- Created by the composition of concepts, which are used to help people know, understand or simulate a subject the model represents. It doesn't have to be a visual model but can be used to represent relationships, feelings, hierachy etc.
  - The primary objective is to convey the fundamental principle and basic functionality of the system in which it represents.
  - Must be develped in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the model users.
    - When implemented properly, the model should satisfy the following.
      - Enhance user's understanding of the representative system.
      - Facilitate conveyance of system details to stakeholders.
      - Provide point of reference for system designers to extract system specs.
      - Document the system for future reference and provide a means of collab.
# Building Personnas
- Design personas - focus on the wants and needs.
- Marketing personas focuses on demographic information, buying motivation and converns, shopping or buying preferences, preferred marketing messages or approach, media or consumption habits.
  - Primary Persona - the main user
  - Secondary Persona - other users.
  - Supplemental Persona - other users.. but they might use the system differently.
  - Customer - a specific buyer type.
  - Served - customers post-purchase
  - Negative - those for whom the design is specifically not intended for.
